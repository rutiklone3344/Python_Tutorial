''' Solving a problem by creating object is one of the most popular approches in programming
This is called object oriented programming'''

# This concept focuses on using reusable code. -> Implements Dry Principle

# A class is the blue print from which specific objects are created

An object is an instantiation of a class.
When class is define, a template (info) is defined.
Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

Objects of a given class can invoke the methoda avaiable to it without revealing the implementation
